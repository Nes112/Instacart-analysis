# Instacart Analysis

## Summary

Using the [Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017), I used Python to work with a dataset containing 32 million rows. I wrangled the data, cleaned it, and merged it with other data into a unified dataframe.

I used the Python matplotlib library to create visualizations and issue recommendations about Instacart's customer base.

## Instacart Final Report

This file contains information about how the data was manipulated, including a population flow, data cleaning steps, column derivations, and visualizations.

The final tab of the spreadsheet also includes answers to the key business questions that were the impetus for the analysis.

## Scripts folder

These are the underlying scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. All scripts are in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
